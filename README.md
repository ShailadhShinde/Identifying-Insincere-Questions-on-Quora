###  üìå Project Overview  <a name="overview"></a>

This project is a Notebook about a Classification problem . An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.  On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.
** The purpose is to develop models that identify these insincere questions. **

- ### About the dataset  <a name="atd"></a>

`The training data `includes the question that was asked, and whether it was identified as insincere (target = 1). The ground-truth labels contain some amount of noise: they are not guaranteed to be perfect.

- ### Embeddings <a name="embed"></a>

    External data sources are not allowed . Although, they have provided a number of word embeddings along with the dataset that can be used in the models. These are as follows:

   - GoogleNews-vectors-negative300 - https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/
   - glove.840B.300d - https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
   - paragram_300_sl999 - https://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/106
   - wiki-news-300d-1M - https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html
  
- ### Preprocessing  <a name="pp"></a>

    - Used all tokens from both train and test data for our vocabulary
    - Split by space afterwards using spacy (Spacy tokenizer)
    - Used glove for embeddings
    - No truncation of tokens
    - Tried stemmer, lemmatizer, spell correcter, etc. to find word vectors
    - Local CV to tune all the hyperparameters
    
- ### Model Structure  <a name="ms"></a>
